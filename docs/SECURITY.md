# Reporting security issues

As Inspektor Gadget maintainers, we take security seriously.
If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You have two possibilities:
1. Using the GitHub feature "Report a security vulnerability" when opening an issue.
It will then create a non-public issue specific to security.
2. Sending a mail to security@inspektor-gadget.io.
If you do not know which information you need to fill out when using the first option, then the second option is the way to go.

In all cases, we ask that you do not open a public issue.
