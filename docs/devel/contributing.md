  How to contribute to Inspektor Gadget.
---

Here you can learn how you can contribute to Inspektor Gadget. If you are
looking to develop Gadgets, please check the [Gadget
Development](../gadget-devel) documentation.

## Getting started

To better understand how the pieces fit together, we recommend reading the
[architecture](../reference/architecture.md) documentation before starting to play with
Inspektor Gadget.

### Setup developer environment

- [Fork](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/fork) and clone this repo:
    - `git clone git@github.com:your_account/inspektor-gadget.git`.
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [Docker Buildx](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx) and [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- To be able to cross build our different container images, you will also need [`qemu-user-static`](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static).

## Building the code

Inspektor Gadget is composed of a client executable that runs on the
operator's machine, and a container image that runs in the Kubernetes
cluster. They can be built together or independently.

### Building the client executable

You can compile the client executable for your platform by running `make kubectl-gadget`.

To cross compile for all supported platforms, you can run `make
kubectl-gadget-all` or select a specific one with `make
kubectl-gadget-linux-amd64` or `make kubectl-gadget-darwin-amd64`.

### Building the gadget container image

You can build and push the container gadget image by running the following commands:

```bash
$ make gadget-container
$ make push-gadget-container
```

The eBPF code is built using a Docker container, so you don't have to worry
installing the compilers to build it.

If you push the container images to another registry, you can use the `--image`
argument when deploying to the Kubernetes cluster.

#### Notes

- Using a locally built container image requires pushing it to a container
registry, either local or remote. The default registry can be overridden by
changing the value of the `CONTAINER_REPO` env variable, which defaults to
`ghcr.io/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget` if not defined.
- You can generate the required BTF information for some well known
  kernel versions by setting `ENABLE_BTFGEN=true`


### Building the eBPF object files

If you need to compile the eBPF code of the gadgets, the ebpf-objects target
will help you in this task:

```bash
$ make ebpf-objects
...
go: downloading github.com/giantswarm/crd-docs-generator v0.7.1
...
```

### Building `ig`

Inspektor Gadget also provides the [`ig`](../reference/ig.md) tool to
trace containers without Kubernetes. It can be built independently from the
`kubectl-gadget` and the gadget container image.

```bash
$ make ig
```

## Testing

### Development environment on minikube

For faster iteration, it's possible to make changes to Inspektor Gadget and
test them on minikube locally without pushing container images to any
registry.

* Follow the specific [installation instructions](../reference/install-kubernetes.md#minikube) for minikube or use `make minikube-start` to start it.
* Deploy the locally modified version of Inspektor Gadget to an already
  running minikube cluster with `make minikube-deploy`.

### Unit tests

You can run the different unit tests with:

```bash
$ make test
```

### Regenerating testdata

Some unit tests depend on precompiled files on
[testdata](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/tree/main/testdata).
These files can be regenerated by running

```bash
$ make testdata
```

### Integration tests

The integration tests use a Kubernetes cluster to deploy and test Inspektor Gadget.
Note that, Inspektor Gadget must be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster before running the tests.
Be sure that you have a valid kubeconfig and run:

```bash
$ export KUBECONFIG=... # not needed if valid config in $HOME/.kube/config
$ make integration-tests
```

### Integration tests for `ig`

#### Kubernetes

The integration tests for `ig` uses minikube for testing different container runtimes.
The default minikube driver used for testing is `docker`. Currently supported
container runtimes are `docker`, `containerd` and `cri-o`. You can start minikube using:

```bash
$ make minikube-start-all
# for single container runtime e.g containerd
$ make CONTAINER_RUNTIME=containerd minikube-start
# for minikube driver other than docker e.g kvm2
$ make MINIKUBE_DRIVER=kvm2 minikube-start
```

And run the test using:

```bash
$ make -C integration/k8s test-all
# for single container runtime e.g containerd
$ make -C integration/k8s CONTAINER_RUNTIME=containerd test
```

if no `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` is specified `docker` will be used as a default runtime.

#### Non-Kubernetes

The `ig` integration tests for non-Kubernetes containers directly interact
with container runtime. The tests assume that you already have the desired container
runtime installed. Currently supported runtime is `docker` only, You can run the test using:

```bash
$ make -C integration/ig/non-k8s test-docker
```

### Benchmarks

You can run the different benchmark tests with:

```bash
$ make gadgets-benchmarks
```

Or you can run an individual test with:

```bash
$ go test -exec sudo \
    -bench='BenchmarkAllGadgetsWithContainers/container10$/trace-tcpconnect' \
    -run=Benchmark \
    ./internal/benchmarks/...
```

Records of previous benchmarks are available [here](https://inspektor-gadget.github.io/ig-benchmarks/dev/bench/index.html).
See details in the [CI documentation (benchmarks)](ci.md#benchmarks).

#### Explaining performance improvements in a PR

If you want to contribute a performance improvement, it is useful to use benchmarks to explain the impact on
performances. I will use the example of an improvement on the networking gadgets from
[#1430](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/pull/1430):

* Run the benchmarks both on the `main` and the feature branches and saving the output in two files.
```bash
$ git checkout main
$ go test -exec sudo \
    -bench='^BenchmarkAllGadgetsWithContainers$/^container100$/trace-(dns|sni)' \
    -run=Benchmark \
    ./internal/benchmarks/... \
    -count 10 | tee main.bench
$ git checkout myfeature
$ go test -exec sudo \
    -bench='^BenchmarkAllGadgetsWithContainers$/^container100$/trace-(dns|sni)' \
    -run=Benchmark \
    ./internal/benchmarks/... \
    -count 10 | tee patched.bench
```

Please use `-count` to gather a statistically significant sample of results.
The [benchstat's documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat) recommends 10 times.

* Compare the results with `benchstat`:
```bash
$ go install golang.org/x/perf/cmd/benchstat@latest # if not already installed
$ benchstat main.bench patched.bench
goos: linux
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/internal/benchmarks

                                                  │   sec/op    │   sec/op    vs base                │

```

* Include the commands used and the output of `benchstat` in your pull request description

#### Profiling benchmarks

You can run the different benchmark tests while using the
[bcc profile tool](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/profile_example.txt).
To be able to see the symbols in the profile, you need to build the binary with
`-ldflags="-s=false"`.

```bash
$ go test -exec sudo \
    -ldflags="-s=false" \
    -bench='^BenchmarkAllGadgetsWithContainers$/^container100$/snapshot-socket' \
    -run=Benchmark \
    ./internal/benchmarks/... \
    -count 100
```

Example of output showing a stack trace including both the userspace and kernel parts:

```bash
$ sudo /usr/share/bcc/tools/profile -p $(pidof benchmarks.test)
    b'established_get_first'
    b'established_get_first'
    b'tcp_seek_last_pos'
    b'bpf_iter_tcp_batch'
    b'bpf_iter_tcp_seq_next'
    b'bpf_seq_read'
    b'vfs_read'
    b'ksys_read'
    b'do_syscall_64'
    b'entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe'

    runtime.goexit.abi0
    -                benchmarks.test (3452330)
        22
```

It is also possible to use [pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof) to profile
the benchmarks with the `-cpuprofile` and `-memprofile` flags.

```bash
go test \
    -cpuprofile cpu.prof -memprofile mem.prof \
    -exec sudo \
    -ldflags="-s=false" \
    -bench='^BenchmarkAllGadgetsWithContainers$/^container100$/snapshot-socket' \
    -run=Benchmark ./internal/benchmarks/... \
    -count 5
$ go tool pprof -top cpu.prof
$ go tool pprof -top mem.prof
```

### Continuous Integration

Inspektor Gadget uses GitHub Actions as CI. Please check dedicated [CI
documentation](ci.md) for more details.

Some integration tests (like AKS and ARO) are only run when a commit is pushed to the main branch or
a new tag is pushed. It's also possible to run those by pusing a branch named `citest/...`. Please
notice that the container images will be pushed to
https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/pkgs/container/inspektor-gadget and those
should be manually cleaned up.

### Commit History Guidelines

When authoring a PR, ensure that the commit history is clean and
well-structured. Each commit should contain the following:

- Title: Describe the change in a concise and clear manner. The title should be
  prefixed with the area that it touches (e.g. gadgets/trace_open,
  operators/ebpf, docs/, etc.). Commit titles should be in the imperative mood,
  e.g. "gadgets: Add gadget to trace open calls", instead of "gadgets: Added
  gadget to trace open calls". Ideally the title should be 72 characters or
  less.
- Description: The commit description is used to explain the purpose and context
  of the changes. It's not mandatory, for instance simple commits fixing typos
  don't need it.
- Use a `Fixes:` tag if the commit fixes a bug. This tag should include the
  first 12 characters of the commit hash introducing the bug. This can be
  generated by including an alias in the .gitconfig file:

  ```
  [alias]
    fixline = log -1 --abbrev=12 --format='Fixes: %h (\"%s\")'
  ```

  Run it like this to obtain the line to add to the commit message:

  ```bash
  $ git fixline b6c9380cde28
  Fixes: b6c9380cde28 ("tcptracer: Add bpf program")
  ```
- Be signed off with the `Signed-off-by:` line.
- Commits handling review comments should be squashed in the original commit.

if you need further help.

### Proposing new features

If you want to propose a new feature or do a big change in the architecture
it's highly recommended to open an issue first to discuss it with the team.

### Writing tests

We use `github.com/stretchr/testify` to make tests less verbose.

## Planning

Our planning is published through two different project boards:

 * [Inspektor Gadget Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/inspektor-gadget/projects/1)
   has the high level view of the big issues that we are planning to tackle
   in the upcoming months.
 * [Inspektor Gadget Sprint Planning](https://github.com/orgs/inspektor-gadget/projects/2)
   has the week-to-week plans of which bugs we are currently working on,
   and the different priorities of the issues involved.

## BCC

### Porting BCC gadgets

This project uses some gadgets based on [BCC](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/). In the past, we
modified the BCC gadgets and executed them from our process, however it was very inflexible and we
decided to integrate those gadgets directly into our code base by rewriting their control plane in
Golang.

If you want to implement support for a BCC gadget, please read the [Rewriting the Control Plane of
BCC Tools in Golang](https://www.inspektor-gadget.io/blog/2022/09/rewriting-the-control-plane-of-bcc-tools-in-golang/)
blogpost that contains all the details about this process.

## Security

For security, we invite you to take at look at the [dedicated document](../SECURITY.md).
