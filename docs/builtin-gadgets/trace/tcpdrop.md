    Trace TCP kernel-dropped packets/segments.

The trace tcpdrop gadget traces TCP packets dropped by the kernel.

### On Kubernetes

In terminal 1, start the trace tcpdrop gadget:

```bash
$ kubectl gadget trace tcpdrop
K8S.NODE         K8S.NAMESPACE  K8S.POD K8s.CONTAINER  PID     COMM  IP SRC                    DST                        STATE        TCPFLAGS  REASON
```

In terminal 2, start a pod and configure the network emulator to drop 25% of the packets:

```bash
$ kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
$ kubectl run --rm -ti --privileged --image ubuntu shell -- bash
root@shell:/# apt-get update
root@shell:/# apt install -y iproute2 curl
root@shell:/# tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem drop 25%
root@shell:/# curl nginx
```

The results in terminal 1 will show that some packets are dropped by the network emulator qdisc:

```
K8S.NODE         K8S.NAMESPACE  K8S.POD K8s.CONTAINER  PID     COMM  IP SRC                    DST                        STATE        TCPFLAGS  REASON
minikube-docker  default        shell   shell          0             4  p/default/shell:45979  s/kube-system/kube-dns:53  ESTABLISHED  FIN       QDISC_DROP
minikube-docker  default        shell   shell          406293  curl  4  p/default/shell:34482  s/default/nginx:80         ESTABLISHED  ACK       QDISC_DROP
```

The network emulator uses a random generator to drop 25% of the packets.
The results may vary.

The gadget tries its best to link the dropped packets to the process which generated it.
In some cases, this information might be missing.

The source and destination addresses are written in condensed form.
It is possible to see more detailed information by reading specific columns or using the json or yaml ouput:

```
$ kubectl gadget trace tcpdrop \
    -o columns=k8s.node,k8s.namespace,k8s.podname,k8s.containername,pid,comm,ip,src.addr,src.port,src.kind,src.ns,src.name,dst.addr,dst.port,dst.kind,dst.ns,dst.name,state,tcpflags,reason
```

```
$ kubectl gadget trace tcpdrop -o yaml
---
comm: curl
container: shell
dst:
  addr: 10.101.116.61
  kind: svc
  namespace: default
  podlabels:
    app: nginx
  podname: nginx
  port: 80
gid: 0
ipversion: 4
mountnsid: 4026533845
namespace: default
netnsid: 4026533672
node: minikube-docker
pid: 412491
pod: shell
reason: QDISC_DROP
src:
  addr: 10.244.0.91
  kind: pod
  namespace: default
  podlabels:
    run: shell
  podname: shell
  port: 35802
state: ESTABLISHED
tcpflags: ACK
timestamp: 1681911565379499967
type: normal
uid: 0
```

### With `ig`

In terminal 1, start the trace tcpdrop gadget:

```bash
$ sudo ig trace tcpdrop -r docker
CONTAINER  PID     COMM  IP SRC               DST          STATE        TCPFLAGS  REASON
```

In terminal 2, start a container, configure the network emulator to drop 25% of the packets, and download a web page:

```bash
$ docker run -ti --rm --cap-add NET_ADMIN --name=netem wbitt/network-multitool -- /bin/bash
# tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem drop 25%
# wget 1.1.1.1
```

The container needs NET_ADMIN capability to manage network interfaces

The results in terminal 1 will show that some packets are dropped by the network emulator qdisc:

```
CONTAINER  PID     COMM  IP SRC               DST          STATE        TCPFLAGS  REASON
netem      456426  wget  4  172.17.0.2:35790  1.1.1.1:443  ESTABLISHED  ACK       QDISC_DROP
```

The following section tells us that QDISC_DROP means the packet was "dropped by qdisc when packet outputting (failed to enqueue to current qdisc)".

### List of drop reasons

The drop reason enum is not stable and may change between kernel versions.
The tcpdrop gadget needs BTF information to decode the drop reason.
The following table shows the list of drop reasons for Linux 6.2.

### Other tools showing dropped packets

The following tools can be used to show dropped packets but they are not focused on containers or Kubernetes:

* [dropwatch](https://github.com/nhorman/dropwatch): interactive tool using [Netlink Devlink Trap](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/devlink/devlink-trap.html) to see drops packets by the NIC.
* [BCC's tcpdrop](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/tools/tcpdrop_example.txt): tool using eBPF and kprobes/tracepoints to show when a socket buffer is released by the kernel.
* [Retis' skb-drop collector](https://github.com/retis-org/retis): tool using various collectors (skb-drop, nftables, ovs) to show the flow of packets in the kernel.
