  How to install.
---

Inspektor Gadget is composed by a `kubectl` plugin executed in the user's
system and a DaemonSet deployed in the cluster.

## Installing kubectl-gadget

Choose one way to install the Inspektor Gadget `kubectl` plugin.

### Using krew

[krew](https://sigs.k8s.io/krew) is the recommended way to install
`kubectl-gadget`. You can follow the
[krew's quickstart](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/quickstart/)
to install it and then install `kubectl-gadget` by executing the following
commands.

```
kubectl krew install gadget
kubectl gadget --help
```

### Install a specific release

Download the asset for a given release and platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/releases/),
uncompress and move the `kubectl-gadget` executable to your `PATH`.

```
$ curl -sL https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget/releases/download/v0.2.0/inspektor-gadget-linux-amd64.tar.gz | sudo tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf - kubectl-gadget
$ kubectl gadget version
```

### Compile from the sources

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kinvolk/inspektor-gadget.git
$ cd inspektor-gadget
$ make kubectl-gadget-linux-amd64
$ sudo cp kubectl-gadget-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubectl-gadget
$ kubectl gadget version
```

## Installing in the cluster

### Quick installation

```
$ kubectl gadget deploy | kubectl apply -f -
```

This will deploy the gadget DaemonSet along with its RBAC rules.

### Choosing the gadget image

If you wish to install an alternative gadget image, you could use the following commands:

```
$ kubectl gadget deploy --image=docker.io/myfork/gadget:tag | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Hook Mode

Inspektor Gadget needs to detect when containers are started and stopped.
The different supported modes can be set by using the `hook-mode` option:

- `auto`(default): Inspektor Gadget will try to find the best option based on the system it is running on.
- `crio`: Use the [CRIO hooks](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/v3.0.0-rc3/pkg/hooks/docs/oci-hooks.5.md) support. Inspektor Gadget installs the required hooks in `/usr/share/containers/oci/hooks.d`, be sure that path is part of the `hooks_dir` option on [crio.conf](https://github.com/cri-o/cri-o/blob/v1.20.0/docs/crio.conf.5.md#crioruntime-table). If `hooks_dir` is not declared at all that path is considered by default.
- `podinformer`: Use a Kubernetes controller to get information about new pods. This option is racy and the first events produced by a container could be lost. This mode is selected when `auto` is used and the above modes are not available.
- `ldpreload`: Adds an entry in `/etc/ld.so.preload` to call a custom shared library that looks for `runc` calls and dynamically adds the needed OCI hooks to the cointainer `config.json` specification. This feature only works when runc is used. Since this feature is highly experimental, it'll not be considered when `auto` is used.
- `nri`: Use the [Node Resource Interface](https://github.com/containerd/nri). It requires containerd v1.5 and it's not considered when `auto` is used.

## Required Kernel Versions

This section summarizes the kernel versions and features that are required to
run the gadgets. This has been generated by testing different Ubuntu versions
and their shipped kernels, hence it's possible that some gadgets works in older
kernels than the one mentioned here.
