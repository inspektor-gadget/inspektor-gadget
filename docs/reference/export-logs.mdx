Inspektor Gadget supports [exporting logs to OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/logs/) using the
otlp-grpc exporter. You can log the events of any datasource by configuring exporters in the `operator.otel-logs`
section of the config file like so:

```yaml
operator:
  otel-logs:
    exporters:
      my-log-exporter:
        exporter: otlp-grpc
        compression: gzip
        endpoint: "127.0.0.1:4317"
        insecure: true
```

This will configure an exporter named `my-log-exporter` with the given endpoint, gzip compression enabled and TLS
disabled.

You can then run a gadget and activate the exporter for it by setting the `--otel-logs-exporter=my-log-exporter` flag.

### Exporter settings

#### exporter

Currently we only support `otlp-grpc`.

#### compression

Compression can be set to either "none" (no compression) or "gzip" (gzip compression).

#### endpoint

IP address and port of the gRPC receiver.

#### insecure

If set to true, the gRPC connection will not use TLS encryption. False by default.

## Annotations

Annotations can be used to define how logs should be generated from a datasource. Let's look at an example:

```yaml
datasources:
  open:
    annotations:
      logs.name: my-gadget
      logs.severity: 13 # equals WARN severity and will be set for every event
      logs.body: "file " + fname + " was opened by " + comm + " (PID " + string(pid) + ")"
    fields:
      timestamp:
        logs.name: timestamp # this expects the field to contain the time in unix microseconds
      ## Alternatively, you could set the severity from a field of any int type like so:
      # severity:
      #   logs.name: severity
      ## You can also set any string typed field as body for the log entry
      # comm:
      #   logs.name: body
```

#### Adding static attributes

Static attributes of types "string", "int64" and "float64" can be added using the following syntax:

 ```yaml
 datasources:
   events:
     annotations:
       logs.attribute.my-attribute-name.value: my-attribute-value
       logs.attribute.my-attribute-name.type: string
 ```

Those annotations can also easily be added at runtime by using the `--annotate` flag.
