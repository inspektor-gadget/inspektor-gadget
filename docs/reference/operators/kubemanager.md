title: KubeManager
---

The KubeManager operator is used when Inspektor Gadget runs on Kubernetes. This
operator keeps track of the pods running on the node by talking to the
kube-apiserver and to the different container runtimes. This operator uses the
pod informer and/or fanotify mechanisms to detect when containers are created.
This information is used to:
- Update the eBPF maps used to filter events in eBPF by Kubernetes concepts like
  pod and container names, namespace, labels, etc.
- Enrich events with container information (see below).
- Attach networking programs to specific containers according to the filtering
  options passed by the user.

This operator uses the mount or network namespace inode IDs to enrich events
with the following fields:

- k8s
  - node name
  - container name
  - pod name
  - namespace
  - pod labels
  - owner
- runtime
  - runtime name
  - container name
  - container ID
  - container image name
  - container image digest
  - container started time
