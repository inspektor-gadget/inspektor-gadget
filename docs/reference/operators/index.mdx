Operators are a very important part of the Inspetkor Gadget architecture. An
operator is a component that performs a specific action, for example, loading
eBPF programs, sorting the output, etc. Operators are modular and they all
implement the same interface. Currently all operators are shipped within
Inspektor Gadget, but we plan to support user-provided operators in the future.

Operators are configured in a pipeline according to their priority.

TODO: Create diagram showing the pipeline here!

## Operator types

Inspektor Gadget uses two different kind of operators.

### Layer Operators

Layer operators handle the different
[layers](../../spec/oci.md#image-layers-and-media-types) that compose a Gadget.
These operators access the information contained on the layer and perform the
actions needed for the gadget to work, like loading the eBPF programs, running
the WASM module, etc.

### Data Operators

Data operators can produce new data or mutate the data produced by other
operators in different ways:
- enrich it (add new information)
- sort it
- filter out specific events
- export it

## Parameters

Operator expose parameters to control them. There are two kind of parameters:

### Global

These parameters have a global scope and can only be set when deploying
Inspektor Gadget. They are intended to control sensitive things like security
configuration that can only be set by the system administrator.

### Instance

These parameters can be set each time a gadget is run and only have impact on
the gadget being run.
