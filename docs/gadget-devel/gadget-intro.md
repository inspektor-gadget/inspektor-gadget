Gadgets are the central component in the Inspektor Gadget framework. A Gadget is
an [OCI image](https://opencontainers.org/) that includes one or more eBPF
programs, metadata YAML file and, optionally, WASM modules for post processing,
etc. As OCI images, they use the same tooling as containers and share the same
attributes; shareable, modular, deployable, etc.

## Data Sources

Data sources are the way a Gadget provides information. A single Gadget can
provide multiple data sources.


:::warning

We are still discussing possible naming changes to this.

### Data Sources Types

There are several types of data sources according to the way the information is
collected and presented.

### Tracers

Tracers are data sources that provide a stream of events as they happen on the
system: a file is opened, a DNS request is performed, etc. These data sources use
a [perf ring
buffer](https://docs.kernel.org/next/userspace-api/perf_ring_buffer.html) or
[BPF ring buffer](https://docs.kernel.org/6.6/bpf/ringbuf.html) to transfer the
events from the Gadget to Inspektor Gadget.

Gadgets providing this kind of data source need to define an event `struct` with
the fields they provide:

```c
struct event {
	// all fields here
};
```

Tracers are marked by using the `GADGET_TRACER()` macro. It accepts the following parameters:

```c
GADGET_TRACER(name, mapname, structname);
```

- name: Name of the data source
- mapname: Name of the perf ring buffer of BPF ring buffer used by the program
- structname: Name of the structure defining the gadget's event

Examples of Gadgets that use this kind of data sources are
[trace_open](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/tree/main/gadgets/trace_open),
[trace_exec](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/tree/main/gadgets/trace_exec),
etc.

### Map Iterators

Map Iterators are used to report statistics like number of files being opened,
bytes going through a network connection, etc. The information is saved by the
Gadget on hash maps where it's then read by Inspektor Gadget.

Gadgets need to define the types for the key and value and a hash map used to store the information:

```c
struct key {
	// types in key
};

struct value {
	// type sin value
};

struct {
	__uint(type, BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH);
	__uint(max_entries, MAX_ENTRIES);
	__type(key, struct key);
	__type(value, struct value);
} stats SEC(".maps");
```

and then mark the data source with the `GADGET_MAPITER()` macro:

```c
GADGET_MAPITER(name, mapname)
```

- name: Name of the data source
- mapname: Name of the hash map used to store the data

[top_file](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget/inspektor-gadget/tree/main/gadgets/top_file)
is an example of a gadget using this data source.
