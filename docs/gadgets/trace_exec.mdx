## `trace_exec` - Monitor Process Executions  

### **Description**  
The `trace_exec` gadget allows users to track process executions inside Kubernetes containers.  
It helps in **security monitoring**, **debugging**, and **auditing** by capturing information about command executions.  

### **Use Cases**  

1️⃣ **Security Monitoring:**  
   - Detects new or unexpected processes running inside a container.  
   - Helps in identifying unauthorized activity, including malware execution.  

2️⃣ **Modification Detection:**  
   - Uses the `Upper_Layer` field to check if an executable was modified inside a container.  
   - If `Upper_Layer=TRUE`, it means the binary was **not** from the original container image, which could indicate tampering.  

3️⃣ **Compliance Auditing:**  
   - Tracks which commands were executed and by which users/processes.  

### **Example Usage**  
Run the following command to trace process executions inside a pod:  

```bash
kubectl gadget trace exec -n <namespace> -p <pod-name>
