Prior to v0.31.0, Inspektor Gadget only shipped gadgets embedded in its
executable file. As of v0.31.0 these built-in Gadgets are still available and
work as before, but their use is discouraged as they will be deprecated at some
point. We encourage users to use [image-based](../gadgets/) Gadgets going forward, as they
provide more features and decouple the eBPF programs from the Inspektor Gadget
release process.
