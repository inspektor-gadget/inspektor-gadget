/*
Package api contains the reference implementation of the wasm API for Inspektor
Gadget. It's designed to be used by gadgets and not by any other internal
component of Inspektor Gadget.

This package requires TinyGo to ensure that stacks are not dynamically moved
between unsafe.StringData and calls to wasm host functions. It doesn't work with
the official Golang compiler.
